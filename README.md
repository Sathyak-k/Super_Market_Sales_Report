# Super_Market_Sales_Report
* Supermarket Sales Report Visualization:
     This project presents a simple yet insightful visualization of supermarket sales data using Python's `matplotlib` library. It includes **three types of charts**—line chart, bar chart, and pie chart—each        highlighting different aspects of sales and stock within a supermarket environment.

# Purpose:
The main objective of this project is to:
   Understand sales trends across different product categories.
   Analyze current stock quantities.
   Visualize the distribution of juice products in a clear and colorful way.

# Short Descriptions:
Visual analysis of supermarket sales data using line, bar, and pie charts in Matplotlib.

Beginner-friendly Matplotlib project visualizing supermarket sales and stock data.

    Percentage display ('autopct')
    Equal aspect ratio for a perfect circle
    Start angle: 140 degrees
